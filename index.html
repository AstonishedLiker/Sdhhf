        <a>I'm Sdhhf, and I've always been good at using people to get what I want 😏. It's just what I do—figuring out how to get others to do things for me. Like the person who owns this website, I used them without a second thought to help myself. Honestly, I'm not that great at the technical stuff. I couldn't even write a simple CoreGui check in Roblox without needing to use PreloadAsync 😅. It just shows that I'm better at getting others to do things for me than actually doing them myself. But as long as I come out on top, that's all that matters to me.</a>
